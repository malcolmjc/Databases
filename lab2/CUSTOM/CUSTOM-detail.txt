(a) Source of the data (URL, name of the person or organization who produced the data)
The data was retrieved via Kaggle. It was produced by Sree Harsha. It can be found at
the following url:

(b) A brief description of the tables you defined and the relationships between them.
The tables I found were I found were one Weather: about weather statistics on a given day, and 
Climbs: about climbing statistics for a certain group on a given day. The two tables can
be related through their dates. Unfortunately I could not declare Date as a Foreign Key within
the Climbs table because there are Climbs on dates not found within the Weather table.

(c) Any mapping challenges you may have encountered.
There were a lot of mapping challenges:
1. Dates in Climbs that don't appear in Weather
2. Dates were formatted weirdly
3. Climbs didn't have any way to logically have a PRIMARY KEY, so I adjusted my script to produce an Id
4. Titles had spaces
5. Decimals had extremely varying degrees and precisions

(d) Three non-trivial questions you might ask based on the dataset you chose
1. When the temperature is below freezing (32), what was the climb success rate?
2. How does climb success rates change when there is a wind speed above 15mph?
3. Which route had the highest success rate?
